NEW YORK TIMES API


Technology Used

HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT
JQUERY
AJAX JSON METHOD
JQUERY ANIMATION
SASS
GULP


In my second project at Red Academy I was asked to create a simple, interactive news website using the New York Times API. I used the AJAX method to fetch the JSON data from the server. I enjoyed learning this method and think I will use it lots in my career. I used the Gulp library to watch, uglify, and and SASS pre processor. I found Gulp tricky to set up and implement. Certain NPM files wouldnt download.  I found the building stages of this project easy at this point in my career. I could use more practice at Javascript as I seem to encounter lots of errors still and needed lots of help. I need to keep practicing my GULP, JAVA, & JQUERY. Overall I think I have a good foundation of knowledge to keep building from in the future.
